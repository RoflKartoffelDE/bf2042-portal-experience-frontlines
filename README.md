# Battlefield 2042 - Frontlines
Experience a mix of Conquest and Rush as you fight for chained control points in a tug-of-war frontline. Both teams fight for one objective at a time. Push the frontline towards the enemy headquarter and finally destroy their MCOMs to win.

## Experience Codes
- **AA1J18** - Frontlines with PVP-AI (Stable)
- **AA1P7Y** - Frontlines with PVP-AI (Development)

## Maps and Capture Point Order
Unfortunately not all maps are currently supported by the underlying "Ground Superiority" mode. Also the location and amount of capture points isn't always in the favor of the frontlines mode. Therefore this is the currently supported map rotation:

### Caspian Border
US MCOMs - B1 - A1 - C1 - D1 - E1 - RU MCOMs
### Arica Harbor
US MCOMs - A1 - B1 - B3 - B2 - C1 - RU MCOMs
### Renewal
US MCOMs - B1 - A1 - D1 - C1 - E1 - RU MCOMs
### Orbital
US MCOMs - A2 - B1 - B2 - C1 - E1 - RU MCOMs
