# Battlefield 2042 - Frontlines
This is an attempt to remake the Battlefield mode "Frontlines" within Battlefield 2042 Portal.

Thanks to `Recon Riptor#2042` for the initial code!

## Experience Codes
- **aaxsk4** - Frontlines with PVP-AI (Stable)
- **aaxrvu** - Frontlines with PVP-AI (Development)

## Maps and Capture Point Order
Unfortunately not all maps are currently supported by the underlying "Ground Superiority" mode. Also the location and amount of capture points isn't always in the favor of the frontlines mode. Therefore this is the currently supported map rotation:
### Caspian Border
US - B1 - A1 - D1 - C1 - E1 - RU
### El Alamein
US - B1 - C1 - A1 - RU  
*Due to a bug, the points C1 and B1 need to be interchanged in the code*  
*[Bug Reference](https://discord.com/channels/870246147455877181/1005929194393440296)*
### Battle of the Buldge
US - B1 - D1 - E1 - RU
